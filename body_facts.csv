brain,"Controls memory and thought!The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system, or CNS.",static/images/brain.png
brainfunction,"The brain is a complex organ that controls all bodily functions, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It acts as the central command center, receiving and processing information from the senses, and sending out signals to coordinate movement, speech, and other functions.",static/images/functionofbrain.png
heart,"Pumps blood!The heart is a muscular organ, about the size of a fist, that acts as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It's the central organ of the circulatory system, receiving deoxygenated blood, sending it to the lungs to be oxygenated, and then distributing the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. This continuous flow of blood is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste products.",static/images/heart.png
heartfunction,"The functions of the heart are to pump blood and oxygen around the body and deliver waste products (carbon dioxide) back to the lungs to be removed.",static/images/functionofheart.png
liver,"The liver is a large organ in your body, like a built-in cleaning and storage facility. It cleans your blood, helps digest food by producing bile, and stores energy. It also plays a role in many other important functions like metabolism, immunity, and vitamin storage. Think of it as a vital factory and filter for your body. ",static/images/liver.png

eye,"In simple terms, the eye is the sensory organ that allows us to see. It works by detecting light and converting it into signals that our brain interprets as vision. The eye has various parts that work together to focus light and create an image on the retina, which then sends information to the brain. ",static/images/eye.png
eyefunction,"Your eyes capture visible light from the world around you and turn it into a form your brain uses to create your sense of vision. Your brain doesn't have sensory abilities of its own.",static/images/functionofeye.png
ear,"Ears are the organs, or body parts, in humans and many other animals that allow them to hear. Ears work by picking up vibrations (tiny back-and-forth movements), usually in the air or water. Then they change the vibrations into signals that the brain understands as sound.",static/images/ear.png
earfunction,"our ears have two main functions: hearing and balance. Hearing: When sound waves enter your ear canal, your tympanic membrane (eardrum) vibrates. This vibration passes on to three tiny bones (ossicles) in your middle ear.",static/images/functionofear.png
hand,"A hand is the part of the body at the end of an arm. Most humans have two hands. Each hand usually has four fingers and a thumb.",static/images/hand.png
