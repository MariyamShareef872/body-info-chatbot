It acts as the central command center, receiving and processing information from the senses, and sending out signals to coordinate movement, speech, and other functions.",functionofbrain.png
heart,"Pumps blood!The heart is a muscular organ, about the size of a fist, that acts as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It's the central organ of the circulatory system, receiving deoxygenated blood, sending it to the lungs to be oxygenated, and then distributing the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. This continuous flow of blood is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste products.",heart.png
